        <h2>Your Data Stays on Your Device</h2>
        <p>Abandon Cart is designed with your privacy in mind. All of your data — including purchase logs, trigger tags, screenshots, regret ratings, and financial profile information — is stored locally on your device using Apple's built-in storage. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.</p>

        <h2>No Accounts Required</h2>
        <p>Abandon Cart does not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal information to use the app.</p>

        <h2>No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
        <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking tools. We do not track your behavior, location, or usage patterns.</p>

        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Abandon Cart offers an optional one-time Pro upgrade processed entirely through Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. All transactions are handled securely by Apple.</p>

        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>The app may request permission to send local notifications (such as lock expiry reminders and streak alerts). These notifications are generated entirely on your device and do not involve any external servers.</p>

        <h2>Photos</h2>
        <p>If you choose to attach a screenshot to a purchase log, the image is stored locally on your device. It is never uploaded or shared with anyone unless you explicitly use the Share feature.</p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all of your data at any time using the "Reset All Data" option in the Profile tab. Uninstalling the app also removes all stored data from your device.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we ever update this privacy policy, the changes will be reflected on this page. Since we don't collect your data, we have no way to notify you directly — but rest assured, our commitment to your privacy won't change.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can reach us at <a href="mailto:aarondavid7712@gmail.com">aarondavid7712@gmail.com</a>.</p>
